  <h3>About the Runequest App</h3>

<p>Welcome to the Runequest App. Runequest is a roleplaying
game created by <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/runequest-glorantha/">Chaosium</a>. This app
allows players and game-masters to create and manage characters, races, homelands, occupations and cults in the game.</p>
<p>Get started by registering an account and signing in.</p>

<p>Afer this, you can start creating a character, homeland, occupation or cult. When you
create and save "building" content, like homelands, occupations and cults, they will be available for any elses use as well.</p>

<p>Characters can also be added to the open roster by selecting the "Open" check-box when you are creating or editing the character. They can then be coped and modified by other users,
making their lives easier and letting them take advantage of your work and
creativity.</p>
<p>As more users share content in this way, it becomes easier for
new and more experienced players to quickly and easily build high quality
character for their Runequest games. I'm looking forward to seeing what you do
with the app.</p>

<p>I've created a <a href="https://trello.com/b/cDEVQreh/runequest-app">Trello board</a> to help manage feedback and updates. Please note that this iteration of the app is still in BETA phase. 
There will be bugs and while I'll make every effort to keep and persist all user-generated content, it may not always be possible. 
If anyone wants to help make the app better, the code is up on <a href="https://github.com/ToferC/rq_web">GitHub</a>. Any suggestions or improvements (especially to front-end JS)
are very welcome.<p>
